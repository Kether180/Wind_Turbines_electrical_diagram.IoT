## Getting started

**NOTE:** Use nodejs v12.13.1 or newer. It is recommended to use either **nvm** or **nvm-windows** to managed and switch between nodejs versions.

1. Clone the project

    ```sh
    git clone https://nordex-nxos@dev.azure.com/nordex-nxos/UI_electrical_diagram/_git/UI_electrical_diagram
    cd UI_electrical_diagram
    ```

2. Install dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Set the Cumulocity environment variables (used both for the dev server and the deployment)

```sh
$env:C8Y_BASEURL = "https://uidev.edge.labor/"
$env:C8Y_TENANT = "edge"
$env:C8Y_USER = "peter_pan"
$env:C8Y_PASSWORD = "n3v3rlAZd"
```

4. Start the dev server

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

Navigate to `http://localhost:9000/apps/electrical-diagrams/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

```sh
npm run build
```

## Deploy

**Note:** The Cumulocity environment variables need to be set before calling this command

```sh
npm run deploy
```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
